The latest ChatGPT models can dynamically call functions you define based on user input. You specify functions in the API request like `get_weather()` or `send_email()`. The model will intelligently choose when to call a function and return JSON matching the function signature. 

This allows creating chatbots that leverage external APIs, converting natural language queries to API calls, and extracting structured data - all by defining functions for the model to potentially invoke. 

The model doesn't actually execute the function - it just returns JSON you can use to call it yourself. You need to parse the JSON, validate it, and call your function as needed. There are risks if functions impact the real world, so build in confirmations before taking actions on a user's behalf.

Functions count against the model's token limit and context size, so optimize them if you hit limits. The overall flow is:

1. Send query and function definitions to the model

2. Model returns JSON adhering to function schema if it chooses to call one 

3. Parse and validate JSON in your code, call real function if valid

4. Send function result back to model to summarize for user

In summary, you can get reliable structured data by defining functions for the model to potentially call. It returns the JSON to execute the functions yourself server-side.
